# cloud-arch-internship
This repository is dedicated to the development of a comprehensive cloud architecture designed during my internship program. The project aims to build a serverless scalable, robust and secure  distributed system to compute the long-running executions

## Repository Structure and Project Components

- "Old versions" contains all prior scripts developed for the foundational architecture.

Within  ```the Google-Cloud-Storage``` branch, can be found:

- The Storage client pack, which includes the script for uploading files to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
